Fluorescence Quantification macro for ImageJ

#Installation
Please copy the file into the ~/plugins/Macros folder of your ImageJ or FIJI directory. From the next start of ImageJ or FIJI, it will appear in the plugins/Macro menu.
Using FIJI (http://fiji.sc/Downloads) is recommended because it comes already with all the Plugins that FluoQ makes use of (e.g. LOCI Bioformat importer).
