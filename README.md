Fluorescence Quantification macro for ImageJ

#Download
Please note, that simply right clicking on the file FluoQ_beta.ijm and save it to a folder does not work. You either need to send a request via GitHub to download this file. 
Alternatively, you could just drop me a mail (frank.stein@embl.de) and I will send you the right file asap.

#Installation
Please copy the file into the ~/plugins/Macros folder of your ImageJ or FIJI directory. From the next start of ImageJ or FIJI, it will appear in the plugins/Macro menu.
Using FIJI (http://fiji.sc/Downloads) is recommended because it comes already with all the Plugins that FluoQ makes use of (e.g. LOCI Bioformat importer).
